## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZaidHassan96/vitalfit.git
   cd vitalfit


   ```

2. **Install Dependencies Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.**

```

## Firebase Setup

1. **Firebase Project**:

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. **Authentication**:

   - Enable email/password authentication (or any other provider you wish to use).

3. **Firestore**:

   - Set up Firestore with rules that allow access based on user roles (trainers vs. members).

4. **Replace Firebase Configuration**:

   - Copy your Firebase configuration and replace the configuration in `firebaseConfig.js` with your project's details.

   ```javascript
   // firebaseConfig.js
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
   };
   export default firebaseConfig;
   ```

## Environment Variables

For security, store sensitive information such as API keys in environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your environment variables there. For example:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Connect to local host

```
npm run dev
```
